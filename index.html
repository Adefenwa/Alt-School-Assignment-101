    <h1>My AltSchool Africa Profile</h1>

    <p><strong>Full Name:</strong> Emmanuel Sotunde</p>
    <p><strong>AltSchool ID:</strong> ALT/SOE/025/4379</p>

    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Sotunde Emmanuel, a frontend developer, multifaceted designer, and a
      writer. I am a creative storyteller and digital content creator passionate
      about using technology to solve real problems. I have been learning
      frontend on my own but the process has been really slow and demanding, I
      suffered inconsistencies because I don’t have a learning or accountability
      partner, but coming to Alt School, I believed I will relate with people of
      the same learning track and be able to be an accomplished software
      engineer. With a background in graphic and motion design, I’ve always
      wanted to build tools and apps that create impact.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
    <p>
      I joined AltSchool Africa to gain a strong foundation in software
      engineering and finally bring my product ideas to life. I love how the
      school combines practical learning with mentorship, which is exactly what
      I’ve been looking for.
