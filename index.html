            designer, and a writer. I’m currently learning Frontend Engineering
            from the School of Engineering. I have been learning fronted on my
            own but the process has been really slow and demanding, I suffered
            inconsistencies because I don’[t have a learning or accountability
            partner, but coming to Alt School, I believed I will relate with
            people of the same learning track and be able to be an accomplished
